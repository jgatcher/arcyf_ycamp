					<h3>NANABA Dawson Asamoh</h3>
					Youth camp has been such a blessing to me over the past three years that 
					I have attended. It was at youth camp that I realized I could stay up all 
					night to pray, and it was when we were taught about 'soaking' 
					that I learnt that God could not only speak to me, but is always speaking to me, 
					if only I would make the effort to listen. It was also at youth camp that 
					I realized that fasting was not only easier, but necessary for me to develop 
					in my spiritual growth. Youth camp has helped improve the quality of my 
					relationships, not only with God, but with other members of the fellowship

					<h3>Anthony Davor</h3>
					Youth Camp has played a supportive role in my christian growth since 2006. 
					Spending time away from the society with like minded friends and people for some days has been for me, 
					a chance to learn and to be encouraged to do the basic things like reading the word and studying it, 
					praying and worshipping the Lord in an amazing atmosphere you sometimes wish wouldn't end.... 
					I remember very well in 2008, i came to Youth Camp with one main question of what i would do as my 
					project work in university. I fasted and prayed about it as one of my prayer topics at camp that 
					year and before camp ended i had what topic to work on, wrote it down and did just that... 
					The results were great and i now look forward to Youth Camp every year for new experiences 
					and expectations. 
					Hope you will make it this year, you will be blessed.

					<h3>Andrew Amegatcher</h3>
					My first Youth Camp in 2004 was a truly horrible experience!!! Yep, not the encouraging words you would 
					expect to hear but it is true primarily because I was there for all the wrong reasons [please don't ask 
					me what those reason were.
					<p>By day 1 I had already decided this was not for me and I said to myself; don’t 
					these people do anything other than pray and don’t they get tired of worshiping? Over the years though, 
					it has become clearer that the Christian walk is not about eating, sleeping and giving thanks to God 
					somewhere in-between. I’ve also learnt to be real with God every step of the way and to concern myself 
					with ‘us’ rather than the guy next to me screaming ‘Kaboooh’.</p>
 					<p> Anyone looking to come to Youth Camp should know that God will NEVER turn down an opportunity to be with 
 					his children. Just gladly come to The King with an expectant heart and he won’t disappoint. </p>
